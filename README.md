_An example script showing to set up a Django with a Jupyter Notebook_

## Data Science for Web Apps
Django is a (very popular) Python-based framework that helps you build web apps frighteningly quickly. A quick Google/YouTube search for Django tutorials and you'll have an avalanche of content coming your way.
Jupyter Notebook is a tool that lets you build python scripts fast. It's especially popular for data science prototyping as it lets you break up your code and re-run parts of your script.

## Why merge the two?
Today, data analytics is (and should be) the mantra behind every successful product owner's launch plan - and as a developers, providing guidance and infrastructure to enable this is extremely valuable. However, combining these two in one stack can lead to some interesting errors and so, I've written this article to help you cross these hurdles quicker than I did. Plus, we'll also be setting up Python in a way to give us a better all round (customisable) developer experience.

## Prerequisites
At this point, you should have a Django development server setup in a virtual environment (if not, there's plenty of tutorials for that). 
This setup uses a Mac (though OS shouldn't matter) with VSCode.
